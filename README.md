üè¶ Financial Microservices Architecture Design & Roadmap
This document outlines the architecture using the C4 Model (Container View) and provides a phased implementation roadmap based on the suggested build order.

1. C4 Container View: Architecture Overview
This view shows the system‚Äôs containers (your microservices), the data stores they own, and the primary communication channels.

Container / Service

Role & Technology

Data Store Owner

Communication

Client Applications

Web, Mobile, or Internal Tools.

N/A

HTTP/REST (via API Gateway)

API Gateway

Spring Cloud Gateway

N/A

Routes all external traffic to internal services. Performs JWT validation.

Auth Service

Spring Boot (Java)

MySQL/PostgreSQL

Manages users, generates JWTs, publishes user-events to Kafka.

Customer Service

Spring Boot (Java)

MongoDB

Manages flexible customer profiles (KYC, preferences).

Account Service

Spring Boot (Java)

MySQL/PostgreSQL

Manages core account state, balance, and interest. Consumes txn-commands from Kafka.

Transaction Service

Spring Boot (Java)

MySQL/PostgreSQL

Initiates all fund movements. Publishes txn-commands to Kafka for processing.

Card Service

Spring Boot (Java)

MySQL/PostgreSQL

Manages card lifecycle, limits, and PIN hashes.

Loan Service

Spring Boot (Java)

MongoDB

Manages complex loan documents and repayment schedules.

Notification Service

Spring Boot (Java)

MongoDB

Consumes all event topics (e.g., txn-events, status-updates) and logs/delivers alerts.

Kafka Cluster

Confluent Platform

N/A

Asynchronous Communication Bus for SAGA transactions and event notifications.

Key Communication Flows:
Request/Response (Synchronous): Client ‚Üí API Gateway ‚Üí Microservice (e.g., checking account balance).

SAGA Pattern (Asynchronous): Transaction Service ‚Üí Kafka (txn-commands) ‚Üí Account Service ‚Üí Kafka (txn-events) ‚Üí Transaction Service.

Event Notification: Any service ‚Üí Kafka (status-updates) ‚Üí Notification Service.

2. 4-Week Implementation Roadmap
This plan focuses on building the services in logical phases, ensuring that each phase delivers a functioning layer upon which the next layer can be built.

Phase 1: Foundation and Identity (Week 1)
Goal: Establish the infrastructure and security framework.

Service

Tasks

Key Deliverables

Infrastructure

Configure Eureka Discovery Service and Spring Cloud Gateway.

Dynamic routing for all services.

Auth Service

Implement users table entity, repository, and basic Spring Security setup. Define user registration and login endpoints.

User registration and JWT generation.

Kafka Integration

Define all core Kafka topic names (user-events, txn-commands, txn-events).

Auth Service successfully publishes a UserCreated event.

Phase 2: Core Data Services (Week 2)
Goal: Establish the primary entities that hold money and profile information.

Service

Tasks

Key Deliverables

Customer Service

Define MongoDB entity for profiles. Implement endpoints to create and retrieve customer profile data.

Working Customer Profile CRUD operations.

Account Service

Define MySQL entity for accounts (including balance). Implement endpoints for opening new accounts. Map Kafka consumer for future use.

Accounts can be opened and retrieved by customer_id.

Inter-Service

Auth Service publishes UserCreated. Customer Service consumes user-events to create an initial profile.

Decoupled user/customer creation flow.

Phase 3: Value Transfer (Week 3)
Goal: Implement the complex, highly-consistent transaction logic using the SAGA pattern.

Service

Tasks

Key Deliverables

Transaction Service

Implement the SAGA pattern: Produce DebitAccountCommand to Kafka. Consume DebitSuccessful/Failed events to update the transactions table status.

Full, robust Withdrawal transaction flow with state management.

Account Service

Implement transactional logic within a @Transactional boundary to safely debit/credit the account balance upon receiving a Kafka command.

ACID guarantees on balance updates.

Card Service

Implement cards entity. Define logic for checking daily/monthly limits before allowing a transaction to proceed.

Ability to link a card to an account and manage card status.

Phase 4: Extensions and User Feedback (Week 4)
Goal: Implement auxiliary services and provide the user with feedback and history.

Service

Tasks

Key Deliverables

Notification Service

Define MongoDB entity for notification logs. Implement Kafka listeners for all event topics (e.g., txn-events, card-status).

Centralized notification logging and processing pipeline.

Loan Service

Define MongoDB entity for loan documents. Implement complex application/disbursement logic. Publish loan-events to Kafka.

Loan application and disbursement logic integrated with Account Service credit flow.

Testing

Complete integration testing across all 7 services.

System ready for deployment and QA.
