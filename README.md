## 1. Overview

**Elevens Bank** is a modular, microservices-based financial system implementing **event-driven architecture** with **Spring Cloud** and **Apache Kafka**.  
Each service owns its database, ensuring **strong data consistency**, **fault isolation**, and **scalability**.  

It supports:
- ‚úÖ JWT-based authentication & authorization  
- ‚úÖ SAGA orchestration for distributed transactions  
- ‚úÖ Reactive event streaming with Kafka  
- ‚úÖ Centralized logging & notification delivery  

---

## 2. Architecture (C4 Container View)

Below is the **C4 Model (Container Level)** view of the system:

```

[Client Apps] ---> [API Gateway] ---> [Auth Service]
|
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ> [Customer Service]
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ> [Account Service]
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ> [Transaction Service]
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ> [Card Service]
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ> [Loan Service]
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ> [Notification Service]

```
                      [Kafka Cluster] <----> All Services
```

````

| Container / Service | Role & Technology | Data Store | Communication |
|----------------------|------------------|-------------|----------------|
| **Client Applications** | Web, Mobile, Internal Tools | N/A | HTTP/REST via API Gateway |
| **API Gateway** | Spring Cloud Gateway | N/A | Routes all traffic, JWT validation |
| **Auth Service** | Spring Boot (Java) | MySQL/PostgreSQL | Publishes `user-events` |
| **Customer Service** | Spring Boot (Java) | MongoDB | Consumes `user-events` |
| **Account Service** | Spring Boot (Java) | MySQL/PostgreSQL | Consumes/produces `txn-commands` & `txn-events` |
| **Transaction Service** | Spring Boot (Java) | MySQL/PostgreSQL | Publishes `txn-commands`, consumes events |
| **Card Service** | Spring Boot (Java) | MySQL/PostgreSQL | Manages card lifecycle & limits |
| **Loan Service** | Spring Boot (Java) | MongoDB | Manages loan applications & disbursements |
| **Notification Service** | Spring Boot (Java) | MongoDB | Listens to all events, sends alerts |
| **Kafka Cluster** | Confluent Platform | N/A | Asynchronous communication bus |

---

## 3. Key Communication Flows

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|--------------|----------|
| **Synchronous (HTTP)** | Through API Gateway for direct requests | `GET /customers/{id}` |
| **Asynchronous (Kafka)** | For distributed transactions & events | `txn-commands`, `txn-events`, `user-events` |
| **SAGA Pattern** | Transaction coordination using event choreography | Withdrawals, transfers |
| **Event Notification** | Any service publishes an event ‚Üí Notification Service processes | `txn-success`, `loan-approved` |

---

## 4. Technology Stack

| Layer | Technologies |
|-------|---------------|
| **Backend Framework** | Spring Boot 3.x, Spring WebFlux, Spring Data JPA, Spring Security |
| **Microservices Infrastructure** | Spring Cloud Gateway, Eureka Discovery, Config Server |
| **Event Streaming** | Apache Kafka / Confluent Platform |
| **Databases** | MySQL / PostgreSQL, MongoDB |
| **Authentication** | JWT, OAuth2 |
| **Containerization** | Docker, Kubernetes (optional) |
| **Build & CI/CD** | Maven, Jenkins / GitHub Actions |
| **Monitoring** | ELK Stack, Prometheus, Grafana |

---

## 5. Implementation Roadmap (4 Weeks)

| Phase | Week | Services | Key Deliverables |
|--------|------|-----------|------------------|
| **Phase 1: Foundation & Identity** | Week 1 | Gateway, Eureka, Auth | Dynamic routing, JWT generation, publish `UserCreated` |
| **Phase 2: Core Data Services** | Week 2 | Customer, Account | CRUD operations, consume `user-events` |
| **Phase 3: Value Transfer** | Week 3 | Transaction, Account, Card | SAGA flow for withdrawals, card validation |
| **Phase 4: Extensions & Feedback** | Week 4 | Loan, Notification | Loan logic, centralized notifications, integration testing |

---

## 6. Service Responsibilities

| Service | Key Responsibilities |
|----------|----------------------|
| **Auth Service** | Manage users, login/signup, JWT token generation, publish `UserCreated` |
| **Customer Service** | Manage customer KYC, preferences, consume `UserCreated` |
| **Account Service** | Manage balances, debit/credit operations, consume `txn-commands` |
| **Transaction Service** | Initiate fund transfers, manage transaction states, publish events |
| **Card Service** | Manage cards, limits, and lifecycle |
| **Loan Service** | Manage loan documents, disbursements, and repayments |
| **Notification Service** | Consume all events, log, and send notifications via email/SMS |

---

## 7. Kafka Topics

| Topic Name | Producer | Consumer | Description |
|-------------|-----------|-----------|--------------|
| `user-events` | Auth Service | Customer Service | User profile creation event |
| `txn-commands` | Transaction Service | Account Service | Command to debit/credit |
| `txn-events` | Account Service | Transaction, Notification | Transaction result |
| `loan-events` | Loan Service | Account, Notification | Loan disbursement updates |
| `card-status` | Card Service | Notification | Card activation/deactivation |
| `notification-events` | All Services | Notification | Unified alert stream |

---

## 8. Getting Started

### üß± Prerequisites
- Java 17+
- Maven 3.9+
- Docker & Docker Compose
- Kafka & Zookeeper (via Confluent or Docker)

### üöÄ Setup Steps
```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/<your-org>/elevens-bank.git
cd elevens-bank

# 2. Start Kafka & Zookeeper
docker-compose up -d kafka zookeeper

# 3. Start Eureka and API Gateway
cd eureka-server && mvn spring-boot:run
cd ../api-gateway && mvn spring-boot:run

# 4. Run each service
cd ../auth-service && mvn spring-boot:run
cd ../customer-service && mvn spring-boot:run
# ...repeat for all services
````

### üß™ Test Endpoints

```bash
# Register a user
POST /auth/register
{
  "email": "john.doe@example.com",
  "password": "password123"
}

# Open a new account
POST /accounts
{
  "customerId": "CUST1001",
  "initialBalance": 5000
}
```

Would you like me to include a **diagram image (C4 Container View)** using PlantUML or Mermaid syntax directly inside the README (so GitHub renders it automatically)?  
It makes the architecture visually clear and looks great in repositories.
